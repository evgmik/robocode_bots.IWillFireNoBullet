# Changelog

## v0.2
Added linear gun to the enemies firing guns.
Tweak to the wave danger, so HawkOnFire hit me less often, though it might be
inverted by need to track the linear gun.

## v0.1
First release. Heavily borrowed from EvBot.
Enemy equipped only with Head On gun. Minimal risk motion. Every bot have full
(available to the master bot) information.
