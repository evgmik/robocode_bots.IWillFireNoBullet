# Changelog

## v2.0

bug fix: guess factor use the lateral velocity from wrong time

New gun: flipLastGuessFactorGun. I note that many bots including my own
have next wave guess factor close to oposite of the previous wave. This gun
tries to exploit it.

## v1.9

New framework.
Undo orthogonal motion. It seems to be a weaker motion

## v1.8

New framework.
Fixed bug introduced in v1.7:  in 1on1 my bot locked itself in a corner, due
to no danger from corner, and only shallow angle search within orthogonal direction to
the enemy.

## v1.7

New framework.

Enemy fires guess factors gun too, new decaying stats guess factor gun, on
1on1 motion more orthogonal to the line to the enemy.

## v1.6
New framework with guess factor gun. Some optimization to reduce unnecessary
CPU load.

## v1.5

Added bullet shielders detection, and fire with offset to circumvent it.
If bot hit enemy bullet, then enemy wave which carries this bullet is removed,
since it has no danger.

Exact path is attempting to find a better path every turn, but with smaller
number of trials than full search.

## v1.4
New framework with randomGun

## v1.3
New framework with fixed circularGun

## v1.2
New framework with circularGun


## v1.1
Framework v1.1 do not expect improvements, since framework was working on
target selection.

## v1.0
Versions of 0.6 - 1.0 skipped, since v1.0 is quite different

Framework lib v1.0, I do not expect drastic improvements since framework
mostly affects gun.

Looks like to many skipped turns are hurting melee performance.

## v0.6
Using v0.6 framework lib

## v0.5
Using v0.5 framework lib

## v0.4
Using v0.4 framework lib

## v0.3
Exact path calculation. Kind of slow (skipped turns) and still not always
exact, especially when small motions with reverse direction are present.

## v0.2
Added linear gun to the enemies firing guns.
Tweak to the wave danger, so HawkOnFire hit me less often, though it might be
inverted by need to track the linear gun.

## v0.1
First release. Heavily borrowed from EvBot.
Enemy equipped only with Head On gun. Minimal risk motion. Every bot have full
(available to the master bot) information.
