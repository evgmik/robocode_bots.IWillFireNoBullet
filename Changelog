# Changelog

## v1.0
Versions of 0.6 - 1.0 skipped, since v1.0 is quite different

Framework lib v1.0, I do not expect drastic improvements since framework
mostly affects gun.

## v0.6
Using v0.6 framework lib

## v0.5
Using v0.5 framework lib

## v0.4
Using v0.4 framework lib

## v0.3
Exact path calculation. Kind of slow (skipped turns) and still not always
exact, especially when small motions with reverse direction are present.

## v0.2
Added linear gun to the enemies firing guns.
Tweak to the wave danger, so HawkOnFire hit me less often, though it might be
inverted by need to track the linear gun.

## v0.1
First release. Heavily borrowed from EvBot.
Enemy equipped only with Head On gun. Minimal risk motion. Every bot have full
(available to the master bot) information.
